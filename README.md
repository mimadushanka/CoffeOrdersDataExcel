# Fun Project Designed to Demonstrate the knwledge of handling data in Microsoft Excel.


**Data Management & Cleaning**

- Data integration: Combined multiple tables (orders, customers, products) using common keys (Customer ID, Product ID), showing relational data modeling.

- Data cleaning: Organized columns for sales, prices, quantities, and customer data; handled missing values like emails and loyalty cards.

- Data transformation: Added computed fields such as Sales = Quantity × Unit Price and Profit.

**Data Analysis & Reporting**

- Descriptive analytics: Created aggregated views such as TotalSales with monthly and yearly breakdowns per coffee type.

- Customer analysis: Built sheets like TopFiveCustomers to analyze purchase behavior and loyalty.

- Country-level insights: Used CountryBarChart for regional sales comparisons, showing segmentation analysis.

**Visualization & Dashboarding**

- Interactive dashboard: The Dashboard sheet summarizes metrics visually, indicating use of Excel charts, slicers, and possibly PivotTables.

- Visual storytelling: Used bar charts, trend graphs, and summary metrics to communicate business insights clearly.

**Analytical & Excel Techniques**

- PivotTables / PivotCharts: Used for summarizing total sales and visualizing coffee type performance.

- Data validation & lookup functions: Likely used VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, or XLOOKUP to connect datasets.

- Date/time functions: Applied grouping by year/month for sales trends (from Order Date).
